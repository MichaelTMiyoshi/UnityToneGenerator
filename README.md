Output audible tones (single frequency) with Unity.

(school project)

This Unity project just outputs two single tones.  It is actually fun to hear pulsing of two slightly out of tune tones.  There is no UI to this project.  Just adjust the stuff with the Unity interface.  This is a quick project just meant to get the single frequency tones (two of them).  The code is taken from code posted by [Benjamin Outram](http://www.benjaminoutram.com/blog/2018/7/13/procedural-audio-in-unity-noise-and-tone).  The original commit had some commented code from an old Unity forum post on the same subject.
